# Calculus Using Python MAT111-2

This repository contains the coursework assignments and projects completed as part of the *MAT111-2* course, covering various topics in *Calculus using Python*. I'm enrolled in Christ University, Bangalore's BS in Data Science and Mathematics program, and I took this course during my second semester with Dr. John Kasper as the instructor.

The repository includes a Jupyter Notebook and a PDF document, along with Python code files and relevant documentation for each topic covered in the coursework. Each assignment or project is structured to demonstrate understanding and application of calculus concepts using Python programming.

## Contents


*Unit 1:* Fundamentals of Python Programming provides a comprehensive introduction to Python programming essentials. It covers installation, basic syntax, variables, data structures, modules, functions, and various programming structures. Additionally, we learned to create standard plots such as 2D and 3D plots, scatter plots, slope fields, vector fields, contour plots, and streamlines, enhancing their ability to visualize data and mathematical concepts.

*Unit 2:* Symbolic and Numeric Computations extended our Python proficiency to include symbolic and numeric computations using SymPy and NumPy packages. Topics include basic algebraic operations, trigonometric simplifications, exponential and logarithmic functions, solving algebraic equations, and applying calculus concepts like limits, derivatives, integrals, and series expansions for both symbolic and numerical analysis.

*Unit 3:* Solving Differential Equations introduced us to solving and analyzing differential equations using Python. We learned techniques to find solutions and plot solution curves for first and second-order differential equations. Additionally, we explored mathematical modeling with first-order differential equations, gaining skills to analyze dynamic systems computationally. This unit bridges theoretical concepts with practical applications in scientific computing and modeling.
