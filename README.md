# Calculus Using Python MAT111-2

This repository contains the coursework assignments and projects completed as part of the *MAT111-2* course, covering various topics in *Calculus using Python*. The course is designed for students enrolled in the Bachelor of Science program in Data Science and Mathematics at Christ University, Bangalore, specifically during the 2nd semester under the guidance of Dr. John Kasper.

The repository includes a Jupyter Notebook and a PDF document, along with Python code files and relevant documentation for each topic covered in the coursework. Each assignment or project is structured to demonstrate understanding and application of calculus concepts using Python programming.

## Contents


*Unit 1:* Fundamentals of Python Programming introduces students to the essential elements of programming in Python. Starting with installation and setup, students learn the basics of Python syntax, including variables, data structures, and functions. They explore the use of modules for extending Python's capabilities and delve into various programming structures for control flow and organization. Additionally, students are introduced to standard plotting techniques, including 2D and 3D plots, scatter plots, slope fields, vector fields, contour plots, and streamlines, providing them with foundational skills for visualizing data and mathematical concepts.

*Unit 2:* Symbolic and Numeric Computations builds upon the fundamentals learned in Unit 1, focusing on both symbolic and numeric computations using SymPy and NumPy packages. Students explore basic algebraic operations, trigonometric simplifications, and manipulations involving exponential and logarithmic functions. They also delve into solving algebraic equations and applying calculus concepts such as limits, derivatives, integrals, and series expansions computationally. This unit equips students with the tools to perform symbolic computations for mathematical analysis and numeric computations for numerical simulations and data analysis.

*Unit 3:* Solving Differential Equations introduces students to the fundamental techniques for solving and analyzing differential equations using Python. Students learn to find solutions and plot solution curves for first and second-order differential equations. They also explore mathematical modeling techniques for representing real-world phenomena with first-order differential equations, providing them with the skills to analyze and interpret dynamic systems using computational methods. This unit bridges theoretical concepts in calculus and differential equations with practical applications in scientific computing and modeling.
